The latex math symbols table sources:

https://github.com/hubutui/fcitx-table-unicode-latex
https://github.com/moebiuscurve/ibus-table-others/blob/master/tables/latex.txt

# Plans

+ Add some symbols that are missing from standard latex (like degree: U+00B0 °) 
+ Sanitize the dict more.
  + The symbols table should only contains those which are in both unicode & Latex
  + Complete Latex Symbols: <http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf>
  + Unicode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operators_and_symbols_in_Unicode>

+ Fuzzy match?
