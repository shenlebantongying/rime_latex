# RIME_LaTeX

Typing LaTeX math symbols in RIME.

Press `\` key then input latex symbol's name: `\lambda` will automatically become `λ`.

## Use as standalone input method

Copy the `latex.dict.yaml` and `latex.schema.yaml` to rime's config folder.

Add those lines to `default.custom.yaml`

```
 patch:
  schema_list:
    - schema: latex
```

## Use with other schemas

For instance, to use with 朙月拼音（简化字）, in `luna_pinyin.custom.yaml` (`luna_pinyin_simp.custom.yaml`)

```yaml
patch:
# type '\' will pull in English punctuation, so need to switch to Chinese punctuation
  switches/+:
    - name: ascii_punct # 
      states: [ ¥, $ ]
      reset: 0
# make '\' go into the candidate box
  speller/alphabet: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\\
# or customize punctuator to make '\' go into the candidate box like below(please uncomment yourself)
#  punctuator/half_shape:
#    "\\": ["\\"]
#  punctuator/full_shape:
#    "\\": ["、", "＼"]

    translators/+:
      - table_translator@latex_input

# meaning of the regex: ^ (start of line), \\(the starting \), .+(any char 1 or more time), $(end)
# first '\\' is recognized as a symbol(half_shape or full_shape). double '\\' make it to be recognized as a pattern
# translator's prefix will consume one '\\'. so user only type once '\' key, only recognize uppercase and lowercase letters, so you can use the number keys to select words.

Note: due to the complexity of mixing rime schemas, you may need extra efforts to mix RIME_LaTeX with arbitrary other schema.

## RIME_LaTeX's extension to tex symbols

### superscript/subscript
```
\^1 \_1 -> X₁¹
\^a \_b -> Xᵃᵦ
```

> [Unicode doesn't have a full set of super/sub scripts, you probably should use text styles or markup in rich text, instead.](https://www.unicode.org/faq/ligature_digraph.html#Pf8)

### Degree

## HELP WANTED

* Check if all Unicode math symbols are included.
  + Complete Latex Symbols: <http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf>
  + Unicode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operators_and_symbols_in_Unicode>

+ Fuzzy match how??
